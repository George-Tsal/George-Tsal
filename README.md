- 👋 Hi, My name is George Tsaliagos and I am from Greece. 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a web/front end developer. I began this journey back in 2023 and so far I've completed courses on Freecodecamp and Codecademy. Plus, I got a degree from a private school in summer of 2024 (IEK INTERGRAPHICS 2023-2024) on the field of web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React. I want to be able to master the basic concepts and familiarize myself with its component-like approach. Also, I'm thinking of diving into PHP and MySql so as to obtain a better understanding of the whole procedure of web development.
- 💞️ If given the opportunity, I would like to participate in web projects in order to get real world experience. 
- 📫 If you want to contact me you can email me at george.tsaliagos@gmail.com
